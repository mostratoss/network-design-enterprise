# Enterprise Network Design

Enterprise network design project developed for the course
Computer Systems & Networks (CN4002).

The project focuses on designing and documenting a small company
network, including routing, IPv4 addressing, firewall configuration
and connectivity to an ISP.

## Overview
The network was designed for a company operating across two floors,
with more than 20 workstations, servers, printers and shared resources.
The design emphasizes clear topology, proper IP addressing and
secure access to external networks.

## Network Components
- Router
- Layer 2 switches
- Firewall (ASA)
- Workstations
- Printers and scanner
- File and database servers
- ISP connection (simulated)

## Key Features
- Enterprise-style network topology
- Static IPv4 addressing
- Routing between internal and external networks
- Firewall configuration with NAT
- Successful connectivity verification using ping tests

## Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Files
- `.pkt` file containing the complete network topology
- Network documentation explaining design choices

## Focus
- Network topology planning
- IPv4 addressing and subnet organization
- Device configuration and connectivity
- Basic network security principles

This project reflects my approach to practical network design
and system-level thinking.
